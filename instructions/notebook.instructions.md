# Notebook & papermill guidance

- Use notebooks for exploration; convert reproducible workflows into scripts for production.
- For parameterised production workflows use `papermill` and record parameters and outputs as artifacts.
- Use an environment that matches project dependencies; record kernel info in notebook metadata.
